     [Bounty $10k] Optimise atan2

     Platform: algora │ Comments: 4 │ Created: 2026-03-30
```

## Features

- **Multi-source**: Searches Algora bounties (💎 Bounty label), GitHub bounty labels, and bounty keywords in issue titles
- **Competition scoring**: Color-coded competition levels based on comment count
- **Smart filtering**: Filter by language, minimum amount, and max competition
- **JSON output**: Pipe to `jq` or other tools
- **No API key required**: Uses GitHub's public search API

## How It Works

bounty-radar queries the GitHub Search API for issues and PRs with bounty-related labels and keywords, deduplicates results, extracts dollar amounts, and sorts by value.

## Limitations

- GitHub API rate limit: ~10 requests/minute for unauthenticated users
- Some bounties don't include dollar amounts in labels/titles
- Results limited to 50 per search query
